    <p>Son Heung-min drew a foul 20 minutes into his Major League Soccer debut on Saturday, to earn Los Angeles FC a 2-2 draw against the Chicago Fire.</p>
    <p>His side trailing to 2-1, the South Korea captain was fouled in the box by Chicago’s Carlos Teran – who had scored the game’s <em>first goal</em> – in the <strong>77th minute</strong>, and the referee eventually pointed to the spot after a lengthy VAR review.</p>
